Data analyst project

TASK 1
CLEANING DATA (FIFA DATASET)
▪ Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions on how
to handle gaps in the dataset.
▪ Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.
▪ Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
▪ Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.

One of the challenges of web scraping is unclean data, and it natural, really. Different front-end developers write the HTML their own way, and that makes the incoming data unpredictable.

Inspiration
Convert the height and weight columns to numerical forms
Remove the unnecessary newline characters from all columns that have them.
Based on the 'Joined' column, check which players have been playing at a club for more than 10 years!
'Value', 'Wage' and "Release Clause' are string columns. Convert them to numbers. For eg, "M" in value column is Million, so multiply the row values by 1,000,000, etc.
Some columns have 'star' characters. Strip those columns of these stars and make the columns numerical
Which players are highly valuable but still underpaid (on low wages)? (hint: scatter plot between wage and value)



TASK 2
FRAUD DETECTION
▪ Identifying unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior within data.
▪ Employing algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks for
predictive analysis.
▪ Selecting and transforming relevant features to enhance fraud detection accuracy.
▪ Implementing systems that can detect and respond to fraudulent activities in real-time.
▪ Designing fraud detection systems capable of handling large volumes of transactions
efficiently.
